you'll go forwards as i walked past my grave in the fog observe her form lying beside the stone the letters she left in my name where i longed to speak the worst of my soul i watch the tears that run down her face drop to the ground without ever knowing that i crossed a wide ocean of change consumed by desperate despair all the way yet despite every hollow remain that i've gone through the ghost is always you behind the chapel walls where my soul's laid to rest there within a moment i understood i the watcher just a silent silhouette behind the gates by god one day help me forgive myself yet despite every hollow remain that i've gone through the ghost is always you she the conspirator will guide my hands and cleanse my soul though i have remained silent the search is over and i let go i will find a voice to describe all the horror inside of my mind with determination i'm just a servant to the silence the silence i despise where in my heart beats a guiding voice a sullen hand to suffer my choice and now to decipher the moment's gone i finally understand my fate and what has to come to be worth the pain ride the seas of change whatever i become incomprehensible like me for that moment her face is gone life's lust my only friend no more the answers to force my own life to change i crossed a wide ocean of change consumed by desperate despair all the way yet despite every hollow remain that i've gone through the ghost is always you breathing 'cause the movement when life is gone still the silent silhouette may my search be over and lend me to rest i felt the anguish in that movement discovering me but consequently give my tired soul to be separate as i walked past my grave in the fog observe her form lying beside the stone you're in control is there anywhere you
